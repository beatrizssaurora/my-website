## About Me

Hello! I’m Beatriz, a bioprocess and biotechnology engineer from UNESP and passionate about technology. I believe that technology has the power to simplify the complex and create elegant solutions for everyday challenges.

I’m currently transitioning my career to the technology field, focusing on backend development and data analysis. To prepare for this new journey, I participated in bootcamps and intensive courses at ADA TECH and ALURA, where I improved my programming and data analysis skills.

I’m a curious person who loves to learn and share knowledge. If you want to follow my journey, follow me on LinkedIn!

My work explores digital interfaces and interactive experiences.
