Welcome to my digital portfolio!

Here, I share my professional journey, projects and passions. I am Beatriz dos Santos Silva, a Bioprocess and Biotechnology Engineer graduated from the S√£o Paulo State University "J√∫lio de Mesquita Filho" - UNESP.

Throughout my career, I have dedicated myself to developing soft skills and acquiring hard skills in technology, keeping up with the constant innovations in the market. I believe that storms are temporary, determination and resilience are essential to overcome challenges and achieve goals.

In this portfolio, I present projects developed in JavaScript and Python, acquired through personal research or through participation in bootcamps, which reflect my philosophy of continuous learning. I constantly seek to explore new technologies to create innovative and impactful solutions in the future.

I am passionate about cybersecurity and believe in the importance of sharing knowledge. The opportunities I have received have inspired me to give back, sharing my knowledge with others. I believe that creativity and collaboration are essential for success in any field.

I invite you to explore my portfolio and learn more about my work and passions. If you have any questions or are interested in collaborating, please contact me.

Thank you for visiting!

Sincerely,

Beatriz dos Santos Silva
